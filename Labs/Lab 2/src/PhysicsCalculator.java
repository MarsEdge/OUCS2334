/**
 * 
 * This class contains static helper methods to calculate various physical quantities from other physical quantities.
 * 
 *  The parameters passed to the methods in this class may use any of the units defined for the variable type.  For
 *  example, a variable of type Distance could use any of the units defined in DistanceUnits but not the units defined
 *  in TimeUnits.
 *  
 *  The returned physical quantities are all in SI, which is the canonical form for this software.
